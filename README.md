# reactor

Bootstrapping repository for building a react app

## How do I use this?

Clone this repository to a new directory that's named what you want your project to be

`git clone git@github.com:msarchet/reactor <app>`

Change the branch to master

`git checkout -b master`

Edit the `project.json` to reflect your project.

Change the remote origin in git to point at your repository

`git remote set-url origin <your-repo-url>`

## Why did I make this?

I'm trying to eliminate all the bike shedding I find myself doing when I want to start a new project. 
So I built this project as a heavily opinonated easy to use starting point for building new projects or for trying new things.

## Pull Requests

I'm open to pull requests against this repository, but it shouldn't replace anything, unless it's a direct improvement of a dependency
